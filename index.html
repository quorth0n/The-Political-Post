        <h3>The War with Mexico, <i>June 1845</i></h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
          It has come to my attention that Texas was previously annexed by the U.S, which has angered Mexico.  Border disputes between independent Texas and Mexico carried over with annexation, causing General Zachary Taylor to blockade the Rio Grande, the border of the disputed territory.  This angered Mexico, causing them to ambush General Taylor’s troops.  Today, I intend to show you, the reader, why a war with Mexico would be unjust, and how you can help prevent it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of our fellow citizens know only of the fact that General Taylor was ambushed while in Texas, and know not that the reason for this was that General Taylor was blockading the Rio Grande, disputed territory between the U.S.  and Mexico.  Taking charge of this land angered many Mexicans, leading them to perform the act that they did.  While two wrongs don’t make a right, three don’t either.  We can’t declare War on Mexico for an act we, unfortunately, started, especially not one with the true intentions that many Southern Imperialists and our President, James K.  Polk, have given.  For example, in a letter to one of Polk’s trusted agents, John Slidell, he stated that he is “extremely desirous to acquire California.” This letter reveals one of Polk’s hidden intentions for declaring War on Mexico -- what I like to call “land hunger”.  Polk could care less about General Taylor’s ambushed soldiers, his true intent is to conquer more of Mexico’s rightful land.  Many Southern Imperialists and slaveholders share this same viewpoint.  Southern politicians are desirous to take Mexican land so that they can extend their inhumane act of Slavery into Mexican land, tipping the balance in Congress while gaining popularity for Slavery by extending it.
        </p>
        <p>
          My fellow American Citizens, no matter what race, religion, or political alignment, we have a misuse of power, and it must be stopped.  If we go to War with Mexico, innocent Americans will lose their lives.  Mexico’s hostilities towards us will reach unreturnable levels.  Slavery-supporting imperialists, such as our President himself and many of his Southern supporters, will have their way in extending the unjust act of Slavery into new territories, tipping the balance of power in Congress in their favor while increasing the popularity of the inhumane act itself.  This War must be stopped, and it is up to us to stop it!

        <h3>Awards for the Industrial Revolution, 1839</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
          <b>Eli Whitney</b><br>Despite all the brilliant inventors and their contributions to American Industry, most manufacturing was still done by hand during this man’s time.  Factories needed better technology to get the work done more efficiently.  In 1798, inventor Eli Whitney attempted to address some of these problems.  He proposed to the U.S. government the idea of using water-powered machinery. Some of the benefits of this, he stated, were that they would greatly reduce the labor of producing goods and would ease the process of manufacturing itself. Whitney is also credited with inventing the idea of using interchangeable parts, or parts of a machine that are identical. This would allow parts to be easily replaced, and would allow them to be produced easier. This practice soon became standard in most industries, speeding up mass production, or the efficient production of large numbers of identical goods.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Thomas Jefferson</b><br>Although he is often ignored in the history of the American Industrial Revolution, Thomas Jefferson was a very influential figure during this time.  He initially had opposed manufacturing, but, upon seeing how beneficial new industrial technology could be to America, he later changed his mind.  During the War of 1812, he realized that since Britain had blockaded most American ports, it was much harder to import foreign goods.  Instead, Jefferson proposed, Americans should start to buy more from American manufacturers and support local industries.  His theory proved to be correct.  Thomas Jefferson, although it was much after his presidency, was still a respected figure by many, and, in the end, changed many of his supporters’ opinions of manufacturing.  We do owe it to Jefferson for the changed opinions of many, and for helping Americans accept the great changes of the Industrial Revolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Samuel Slater</b><br>Samuel Slater was a very important pioneer in the Industrial Revolution.  Disguised as a farmer, he memorized the patterns of textile mill machines, and immigrated to the U.S.  Upon arrival, he notified Moses Brown, a textile business owner in New England, that he could greatly improve his method of manufacturing.  Using textile mill machines turned out to be a huge success!  Slater began opening textile mills all over New England, which was chosen because of its many rivers and the fact that Southerners were mainly opposed to Industry, while Northerners generally supported it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Richard Arkwright</b><br>Most people in the beginning of the 1700s were poor farmers who hand-crafted most of what they needed.  Fast-forward to the mid-1700s, when they times start to change.  Population increases rapidly.  As it does so, the need for more goods produced more quickly does as well.  Craftsmen ditch their hands for automated machines. One of the earliest pioneers in automated machinery for crafting was Englishman Richard Arkwright, who invented a large spinning machine called the water frame. The water frame could produce dozens if cotton threads at the same time, which lowered costs and increased manufacturing speed.  Because of this, Britain soon had the world’s most productive textile manufacturing industry, and the Industrial Revolution became well on its way, transforming people of every developed nation’s lives.

        <h3>Andrew Jackson, Hero or Villain? <i>October, 1837</i></h3>
        <hr>
        <p style="font-style:italic;">
          Editor's note: As President Andrew Jackson nears his final term, we aksed two men with polarizing opinions on him to speak their mind. Their responses are below...
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>James Boyre, Textile worker: </strong> Jackson is a hero because he is a war hero, helped set America on the path of giving minorities the right to vote, and nearly eliminated the federal debt. Andrew Jackson is famous for winning many battles. Among the most influential on the respective war include the Battle of New Orleans, the Battle of Pensacola, and the various battles of the Creek and Seminole wars. Andrew Jackson is also credited with started the movement of Jacksonian Democracy in America, or giving the common man the right to vote. He is also noted for greatly decreasing the federal debt by fighting the Second National Bank of the United States. In conclusion, Jackson is a hero for the above reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Richard Nelson, Plantation owner: </strong> Jackson is a villain because he ignored the Constitutional rulings of the Supreme Court, signed the Indian Removal Act, and abused the power of the Executive Veto. When the Supreme Court ruled that “Worcester's conviction is void, because states have no criminal jurisdiction in Indian Country.” in Worcester v. Georgia, Jackson refused to enforce this decision after Georgia ignored the ruling. His main executive duty was to do so. Jackson also went even further and signed the Indian Removal act in 1830, directly causing more than 2,000 Native Americans to die on what became known as the Trail of Tears. Jackson also was the first president to veto bills passed by Congress merely because he didn’t like them, and set a bad example for later presidents to do the exact same thing. Prior presidents would reserve the power of the veto only for bills they thought were unconstitutional, putting their opinions on the bill aside. In conclusion, Jackson is a villain for the above reasons.
