        <h3>The War with Mexico, <i>June 1845</i></h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
          It has come to my attention that Texas was previously annexed by the U.S, which has angered Mexico.  Border disputes between independent Texas and Mexico carried over with annexation, causing General Zachary Taylor to blockade the Rio Grande, the border of the disputed territory.  This angered Mexico, causing them to ambush General Taylor’s troops.  Today, I intend to show you, the reader, why a war with Mexico would be unjust, and how you can help prevent it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of our fellow citizens know only of the fact that General Taylor was ambushed while in Texas, and know not that the reason for this was that General Taylor was blockading the Rio Grande, disputed territory between the U.S.  and Mexico.  Taking charge of this land angered many Mexicans, leading them to perform the act that they did.  While two wrongs don’t make a right, three don’t either.  We can’t declare War on Mexico for an act we, unfortunately, started, especially not one with the true intentions that many Southern Imperialists and our President, James K.  Polk, have given.  For example, in a letter to one of Polk’s trusted agents, John Slidell, he stated that he is “extremely desirous to acquire California.” This letter reveals one of Polk’s hidden intentions for declaring War on Mexico -- what I like to call “land hunger”.  Polk could care less about General Taylor’s ambushed soldiers, his true intent is to conquer more of Mexico’s rightful land.  Many Southern Imperialists and slaveholders share this same viewpoint.  Southern politicians are desirous to take Mexican land so that they can extend their inhumane act of Slavery into Mexican land, tipping the balance in Congress while gaining popularity for Slavery by extending it.
        </p>

          My fellow American Citizens, no matter what race, religion, or political alignment, we have a misuse of power, and it must be stopped.  If we go to War with Mexico, innocent Americans will lose their lives.  Mexico’s hostilities towards us will reach unreturnable levels.  Slavery-supporting imperialists, such as our President himself and many of his Southern supporters, will have their way in extending the unjust act of Slavery into new territories, tipping the balance of power in Congress in their favor while increasing the popularity of the inhumane act itself.  This War must be stopped, and it is up to us to stop it!

        <h3>Andrew Jackson, Hero or Villain? <i>October, 1837</i></h3>
        <hr>
        <p style="font-style:italic;">
          Editor's note: As President Andrew Jackson nears his final term, we aksed two men with polarizing opinions on him to speak their mind. Their responses are below...
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>James Boyre, Textile worker: </strong> Jackson is a hero because he is a war hero, helped set America on the path of giving minorities the right to vote, and nearly eliminated the federal debt. Andrew Jackson is famous for winning many battles. Among the most influential on the respective war include the Battle of New Orleans, the Battle of Pensacola, and the various battles of the Creek and Seminole wars. Andrew Jackson is also credited with started the movement of Jacksonian Democracy in America, or giving the common man the right to vote. He is also noted for greatly decreasing the federal debt by fighting the Second National Bank of the United States. In conclusion, Jackson is a hero for the above reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Richard Nelson, Plantation owner: </strong> Jackson is a villain because he ignored the Constitutional rulings of the Supreme Court, signed the Indian Removal Act, and abused the power of the Executive Veto. When the Supreme Court ruled that “Worcester's conviction is void, because states have no criminal jurisdiction in Indian Country.” in Worcester v. Georgia, Jackson refused to enforce this decision after Georgia ignored the ruling. His main executive duty was to do so. Jackson also went even further and signed the Indian Removal act in 1830, directly causing more than 2,000 Native Americans to die on what became known as the Trail of Tears. Jackson also was the first president to veto bills passed by Congress merely because he didn’t like them, and set a bad example for later presidents to do the exact same thing. Prior presidents would reserve the power of the veto only for bills they thought were unconstitutional, putting their opinions on the bill aside. In conclusion, Jackson is a villain for the above reasons.
